p. Joinx is a lightweight tool for performing set operations (e.g., intersection, difference, ...) on genomic data contained in .bed files. It also provides some limited analysis functions (concordance reports). An important assumption that joinx makes is that the input data is always sorted. This allows it to compute its results in an efficient manner.
