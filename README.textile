h1. joinx

p. Joinx is a lightweight tool for performing set operations (e.g., intersection, difference, ...) on genomic data contained in .bed files. It also provides some limited analysis functions (concordance reports). An important assumption that joinx makes is that the input data is always sorted. This allows it to compute its results in an efficient manner.

h2. Build instructions

h3. Setup repository
* Clone the git repository
* Initialize submodules:
 @git submodule update --init@

h3. Install build dependencies

Building requires:
* cmake 2.8+
* boost 1.40+
* gtest (google unit testing framework, optional for unit tests)
* samtools

To install these on Ubuntu, try:

p.  @sudo apt-get install cmake libboost-all-dev libgtest-dev libbam-dev@

h3. Build and test
* Joinx does not support in source builds. Create a new build directory, enter it, and run:
@cmake /path/to/joinx/repo@
@make@
@ctest@
* Binaries can be found in the bin/ subdirectory of your build directory
